Lesbian Wednesday Addams Twitter Bot
Version 1.8

Changes made:
    > Some of the strings in the tweetlist have been altered to prevent reoccurences of errors that had prevented successful execution of the tweet() variable in the past.

    > Implemented handling of errors such that when another one inevitably happens, I'll be in a better position when working out what caused it in the first place. Stumbled upon a bot relating to Steve Buscemi (ejach/steveBot) when looking for a way to implement it. If it works, then I think whoever created that bot for the solution.
